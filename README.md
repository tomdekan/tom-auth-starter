Hi all, 

This is a repo containing a starter template for auth for Next.js with BetterAuth.

You can fork this and then start working on your new Next.js project rapidly.

This is the final product of my guide here:

Demo video of the finished product is here:

2. Install packages

```bash
pnpm install
