Hi all, 

This is a repo containing a starter template for auth for Next.js with BetterAuth.

You can fork this and then start working on your new Next.js project rapidly.

See a video demo, with a full video to build this from scratch, here:

## To run

1. add a .env file with the variables listed in the guide above
2. Install packages

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run the dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

If any doubt, read my [guide here](https://tomdekan.com/articles/google-sign-in-nextjs)
